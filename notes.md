## TODO
- Check Data tables being used for page reset on changes
- Look into the year logic for the scheduled payments. is the year of the due date or year of the calendar edition? Somehow there was a 1/15/2026 scheduled payment due date but the year was 2025. Look into this issue. seems to only have happened multiple times for January.
- cannot edit a purchase. getting a infinte loop
- confirm year logic all over the code for clarity
